Nx - kernel from scratch

*This project is here for historical reasons and is not under active development.*

Nx is a simple (yet only x86) multiprocess operating system kernel written in C (and some parts in assembly) from scratch.
Our goal is to achieve high performance, speed, flexibility and security by using the simplest possible design.
